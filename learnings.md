# Adding styles to your components

Up to now we've added a component but without any classes or styles. Let's learn how to add some.

We'll go through adding styles three ways:

1. Inline aka 1995
2. Through creating a variable per line of CSS
3. Through the use of a JavaScript object

Create a file called something like ```hello-styles.html```. Inside that file the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <title>Hello React Styles!</title>
    <script src="/react-et-al/build/react-with-addons.js"></script>
    <script src="/react-et-al/build/JSXTransformer.js"></script>
    <style>
      .important {
        
        color: blue;
        
      }
      
      .flipping-awesome-guy {
        
        text-transform: uppercase;
        
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="comments"></div>
    <script type="text/jsx">
    
      var commentStyles = {
      
        //inline method
        color: 'pink',
        fontSize: "15px"
      
      };
    
      var Comment = React.createClass({
          render: function(){
              
              // manual class way
              var yourClassName = 'important';
              
              // class in an object way
              var classObjectWay = React.addons.classSet;
              var classes = classObjectWay({
                'flipping-awesome-guy': true
              });
          
              return (
                  <div id="comment-3">
                    <h1 style={commentStyles}>Oh man, this is well styled</h1>
                    <p className={yourClassName}><span className={classes}>by Andrew Duckworth</span></p>
                  </div>
              );
          }
      });
      
      React.render(
          <Comment/>,
          document.getElementById('comments')
      );
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Quite a bit of code there and a few major things to cover.

One of the important things is that we have added some amazing styles to the code itself. Feel free to add.

The second important one is the use of the ```react-with-addons.js``` version of React.js instead of the vanilla JS. As you might have guessed, we use an addon.

Make sure you link to the addons file correctly and have some styles to call. Let's go through how to add classes to React.js strategy by strategy.

## adding styles inline

To add styles inline we create a variable and an object in which we add the styles. We create the CSS using the JavaScript names - like you would in jQuery - so instead of ```font-size``` is it ```fontSize```.

To get this into the Comment we add it into the HTML template, within the render function like so:

```js
var Comment = React.createClass({
          render: function(){
          
            // Other code removed for clarity
              
              return (
                  <div id="comment-3">
                    <h1 style={commentStyles}>Oh man, this is well styled</h1>
                    // ...
                  </div>
              );
          }
      });
```

As you can see, we write the html style attribute and inject into that, via a moustache ```{}```, the variable ```commentStyles```.

This way is pretty nice in terms of writing the CSS in a variable/object, but it isn't great in terms of the final markup.

## adding classes

The second way of adding a class is to add the desired class to your application through a single class variable declaration.
