# Learning React.js

React.js is a javascript framework created by Facebook and the team at Instagram. 

It focuses on creating "Views" and as such doesn't try to replicate the entirety of an MVC framework on the "front-end".

## Getting React.js into your HTML

The first thing you have to do is download their starter pack. This is easily achieved by "wget-ing" the pack:

```shell
wget http://facebook.github.io/react/downloads/react-0.13.3.zip
```

>> Copying this will get the pack version 0.13.3, so when that is no longer the latest, find the version number you need

You can then unzip the file and either browse the examples or use the code to create your own. 

To unzip and delete the zip file in one line, you can do something like this:

```shell
unzip react-0.13.3.zip && rm react-0.13.3.zip
```
